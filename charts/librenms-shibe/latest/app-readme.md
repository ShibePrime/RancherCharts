# LibreNMS

[LibreNMS](https://LibreNMS.org/) is a fully featured network monitoring system that provides a wealth of features and device support.

This chart bootstraps a [LibreNMS](https://github.com/librenms/docker) deployment on a [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io) cluster using the [Helm](https://helm.sh) package manager. The chart also packages the [Bitnami MariaDB chart](https://github.com/kubernetes/charts/tree/master/stable/mariadb) to provide the backend database for the libreNMS application.
